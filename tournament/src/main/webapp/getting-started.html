<h2>Tournament Pool and Bracket Tracker</h2>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<P>
The development and testing of the system has only been done in <UL>
    <LI> Jetty (latest available from Maven)</LI>
    <LI> MySQL (the latest 5.6 version)</LI>
    <LI> IntelliJ IDEA</LI>
</UL>
The following were tested in previous versions, and may work, but may no longer:<UL>
    <LI> Tomcat v5, v6, and v7 (v7 on Mac has known issues)</LI>
    <LI> MySQL Ver 12.21 Distrib 4.0.15, and the latest 5.6 version for Win95/Win98 (i32)</LI>
    <LI> Eclipse</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<p>
There are several prerequisites (programs you must have installed) to set the tournament bracket tracker up.
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html">MySQL</a>
<li> Sun JDK 1.6.  You can get this from <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>.
	If you use Tomcat 5.5, you can get away with just the JRE, which you can get easily from
	<a href="http://java.com">java.com</a>.  If you are working off of Linux, be aware that gcj doesn't work.
	Some Linux distributions already have gcj installed and use it to run the already
	installed version of tomcat.  This doesn't work yet, and I don't have a Linux box
	at the moment to figure out why.  Installing the Sun JDK worked for another user
	in this situation.
<li> Tomcat or another J2EE container.  I suggest
	<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi">Tomcat 7</a>.
<li>
Once you have tomcat installed, you must make it available from your web server.
How this is done is different for every web server.  If you have Apache, then you need to
use the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi">mod-jk2 connector</a>.
</li>
<li>Put the tournament.war file in the tomcat 'webapps' folder.</li>
<LI>To get the database ready, run the following commands from the mysql.exe tool in the following order:
<pre>
\. [path]\db\setup\db.sql
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\ncaa.sql
\. [path]\db\data\teams\ncaa-teams.sql
\. [path]\db\data\teams\ncaa-leagues.sql
\. [path]\db\data\example\ncaa-2004.sql (optional)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\11team.sql (optional - for ACC and Big 10 tournaments)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\12team.sql (optional - for Big 12, Big East, and SEC tournaments)
\. [path]\db\data\teams\acc-league.sql (optional)
\. [path]\db\data\example\acc-2005.sql (optional)
\. [path]\db\data\example\ncaa-2005.sql (optional)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\nit.sql (optional - for National Invitation Tournament)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\nit32.sql (optional - for National Invitation Tournament 32 Team)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\worldcup.sql (optional - for World Cup Stage 2)
</pre>
<LI>To upgrade from a different version, run as appropriate
<pre>
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade2to3.sql (if starting at 0.2.x)
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade3to4.sql (if starting at 0.3.x)
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade4to5.sql
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade5to5_1.sql
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade5_1to5_2.sql
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade5_2to6.sql
\. [path]\db\setup\upgrade6to6_1.sql
\. [path]\db\data\teams\ncaa-leagues.sql (add league data for simpler admin)
\. [path]\db\data\teams\acc-league.sql (optional - add league data for simpler admin)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\11team.sql (optional - for ACC and Big 10 tournaments)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\12team.sql (optional - for Big 12, Big East, and SEC tournaments)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\nit.sql (optional - for National Invitation Tournament)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\nit32.sql (optional - for National Invitation Tournament 32 Team)
\. [path]\db\data\tournamentTypes\worldcup.sql (optional - for World Cup Stage 2)

javax.mail is now supported.  You can get it from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138643.html">Oracle</a>.
In your jdbc.properties file, you may want to use the following properties to so that password change notices are sent properly.
<ul>
<li>adminEmail</li>
<li>smtpServerHost</li>
<li>mail.userName</li>
<li>mail.password</li>
<li>mail.smtp.host</li>
<li>mail.smtp.port</li>
<li>Anything that starts with mail.smtp will be passed automatically to Java Mail.  Use these to configure security.</li>
</ul>

<LI>
You need to grant privileges in mysql as well:
<PRE>
GRANT ALL PRIViLEGES ON *.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'testpw' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>
You may add a file named jdbc.properties and override any properties you want
(including userids and passwords).  This file will never be included in a distribution
and is safe from being overridden.  Put it next to tournament.properties in
WEB-INF/classes/config/ or anywhere else on the system class path.  
See the note on email above.
</LI>
<LI>
The tweaks to Tomcat necessary in older versions is no longer required as of 0.6.2.
</LI>
<LI>
To enable automatic score updates from the Internet, you will need to find your own source.
Version 0.6.2 enables a 'plug-in' that you may freely implement without having to adhere to the 
GNU Affero GPL v3 for your plug-in implementation as a special exception that the copyright 
holder is making.
<OL>
<LI>Implement the com.tournamentpool.controller.autoupdate.ScoreSource interface.</LI>
<LI>Then add these properties to your jdbc.properties file:
<pre>
autoUpdate.leagues=<i>the ids of the leagues you want to enable updates for, separated by a comma (,)</i>
#autoUpdate.tournamentDetectTimeInMins=60
#autoUpdate.refreshDelayInSeconds=30
scoreSource.<i>{league-id from above]</i>.uri=<i>The URL you want to load scores from</i>
scoreSource.<i>{league-id from above]</i>.class=<i>Full package and class name of your ScoreSource implementation class.</i>
scoreSource.<i>{league-id from above]</i>.classLocation=<i>File system location of the ScoreSource implementation class.</i>
</pre>
</LI>
<LI>Make sure to use double back-slashes (\\) for your path separators.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<!-- <LI>Make some tweaks to the [tomcat home]/conf/web.xml file.  Uncomment the following:
	<PRE>
    &lt;!-- The invoker servlet --&gt;
    &lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt;
          org.apache.catalina.servlets.InvokerServlet
        &lt;/servlet-class&gt;
        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;param-name&gt;debug&lt;/param-name&gt;
            &lt;param-value&gt;0&lt;/param-value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;
        &lt;load-on-startup&gt;2&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
    &lt;/servlet&gt;
	</PRE>
	and
	<PRE>
    &lt;!-- The mapping for the invoker servlet --&gt;
    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/servlet/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
	</PRE>
	This enables the autoinvoker servlet, which maps from URLs to class names which happen to
	be J2EE servlet classes.  Some people consider this a security risk, which is why it is
	disabled by default.  I've never had an issue so
	long as I know all of the servlet classes I have in the system.  This can be changed.  If you
	consider it an issue, let me know via a feature request.
